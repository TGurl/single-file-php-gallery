# single-file-php-gallery
Single File PHP Gallery is a web gallery in one single PHP file. All you have to do is copy the script to any directory containing images to make a gallery. Sub directories will be sub galleries. Thumbnails for images and directories are generated automatically. Single File PHP Gallery does not require any configuration or programming skills to use.
